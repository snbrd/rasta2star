        RASTA is our tax-free currency for the Zion Labs artistic ecosystem. Our art and launchpad creation is our
        stored value.

      <p>
        35% of all ZIONLION BNB Art Sales are used to store into the Big Fat Rasta treasury, creating an everlasting
        increase of value through art.
      </p>

      <p>10% of all Rasta staking rewards are put into liquidity to maintain effective trading.</p>

      <p>
        For a sustainable future and longevity of our Zion Labs eco system, we will always be tax free. We believe art
        has a big future in blockchain adoption.
